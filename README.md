This is a Bill Information assignment app created using
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) with your browser to see
the result.

Accept the self-signed certificate. This step is required to prevent CORS errors
when accessing the API.

This project uses:

- [`Material UI`](https://mui.com/) open-source component library that provides
  pre-built UI components for React, implementing Google's Material Design
  principles to help developers build beautiful and accessible user interfaces
  faster..
- [`React Query`](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs) a powerful
  data-fetching library for React applications. It simplifies the process of
  fetching, caching, synchronizing, and updating server state.
- [`React Redux`](https://react-redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started) the
  official React UI bindings layer for Redux. It lets your React components read
  data from a Redux store, and dispatch actions to the store to update state.
